# Parteractive
Parteractive is a personal project of mine. Combining sensor-reading arduino boards, and making them interact with a simple particle system.

This repository's aim is to show an idea and the possibility of combining IoT devices with other technologies. Hopefully this showcase can inspire and lead to projects and ideas with IoT based technologies.

The boards & sensor I used writing this repository are:
- ESP8266
- HC-SR04 (Ultrasonic Sensor)

# TODOs
1. Create a demo website
2. Record a demo video
